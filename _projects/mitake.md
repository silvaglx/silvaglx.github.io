This Saturday I decided to visit Mount Mitake (御岳山) for appreciating Japan autumn colors. Mt. Mitake is a famous hiking spot located in Okutama city, 2h away from Tokyo center by train. This year, due to El Niño influence causing an anomalous high temperature weather, the famous kōyō (紅葉) proccess was delayed. November 6th was recorded as the warmest autumn day in Japan since 1923. Many locals from famous kōyō sightseeings spots are describing how the colors this autumn are not that vibrant as it was supposed to be when compared to previous years. Even so, the hike was very nice and I was able to spot many beautiful trees along the way. Here are some of my shoots taken with the film camera. Like always, still learning the best settings to improve the quality of my shoots. At least, I'm glad this time I was able to slitghly avoid the bright overexposure effect that I was getting in previous shoots.

    On my way to Mt. Mitake. The buses in the images were the ones I was supposed to take from Mitake station until the hiking departure point. Unfortunetely, I didn't properly search how to reach it so I came by walking since Mitake station. It was a long and steep walk but I was glad I could see more about the city.

    Reaching Mt. Mitake departure point. In this site you are able to choose two ways of starting your hike: taking a cable car until the Mt. Mitake village or going by walk. Since I was late (and a bit tired) due to my previous mistakes and wanted to enjoy more of the hike uphill, I decided to go for the cable car.

    At the Mt. Mitake village you could find a very nice view from Tokyo area. The path leading to the major hiking trails was a conifer vegetation scenary, where some beautiful momiji (栴) -- Japanese maple tree famous for its vibrant red color -- could be seen along the way.

From Mt. Mitake the peak you can have a glimpsy of Okutama chain formations as well as Kanto area. By taking the hiking trail starting from the village you could reach the Mitake Rock Garden (御岳岩石園), Ayahiro Falls (綾広の滝) and the Tengu-no-koshikake Cedar (天狗の腰掛け杉), which unfortunetely I didn't registered in film.
