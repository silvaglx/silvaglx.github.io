I'm a marine scientist from Brazil, mainly interested in coral conservation and how connectivity modeling can be used for securing ocean biodiversity in the face of climate change. Graduated in Oceanography at the <a href='https://www.io.usp.br/'>University of Sao Paulo (USP)</a> and Master in Remote Sensing from the <a href='https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br'>National Institute for Space Research (INPE)</a>, I had also worked with statistical analysis applied to paleoclimate events, influence of land-use change in water quality parameters, oceanic fronts and marine heatwaves variability. You can read more about my projects in the <a href='https://silvaglx.github.io/research/'>research</a> tab. A selection of publications in peer-reviewed journals and meetings are also available <a href='https://silvaglx.github.io/publications/'>here</a>. Currently, I'm a PhD student at the Institute of Science Tokyo (東京科学大学) under the <a href='http://www.nakamulab.mei.titech.ac.jp/homepage_eng'>NakamuLab</a>.
