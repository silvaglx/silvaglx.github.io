Hi!
I'mGraduated in Oceanography from the Oceanographic Institute of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IOUSP) and Master in Remote Sensing from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). During my graduation, I developed scientific initiation projects on Geological Oceanography, with emphasis on paleoclimatology and paleoceanography studies. In my master's, my main research focus was on evaluating the connectivity patterns of Brazilian coral reefs based on larval dispersion simulations, as well as their potential influence on the variation of thermal stress tolerance through satellite data. I also conducted studies on the identification of marine heatwaves along the Brazilian coast and the impact of land cover change on the water quality of Santos Bay (SP). Now, I am a research assistant at the Multi-User Satellite Ocean Monitoring Laboratory (MOceanS), working in the meteoceanographic characterization of the Santos Basin based on remote sensing products.
