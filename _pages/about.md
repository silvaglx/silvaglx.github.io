I'm Gabriel, a marine scientist from Brazil mainly motivated for transdisciplinary approaches to understand ocean ecosystem dynamics. Graduated in Oceanography at the University of São Paulo (USP) and Master in Remote Sensing from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), I'm particularly interested in coral conservation and how connectivity modeling can be used for prioritizing areas for securing biodiversity in the face of climate change. I had so far worked with statistical analysis applied to paleoclimate events, land-use change in water quality parameters and marine heatwaves variability, which you can read more about here. 

andalready adressed how the coral connectivity among South Atlantic reefs can potentially shape the thermal stress tolerance of these populations. I had also worked with different topics, such as. You can see a review on my tab.
