Graduated in Oceanography at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and Master in Remote Sensing from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), I'm particularly interested in using coral connectivity modeling for prioritizing areas for coral conservation in the face of climate change. In my masters, I had already adressed how the coral connectivity among South Atlantic reefs can potentially shape the thermal stress tolerance of these populations. I had also worked with different topics, such as. You can see a review on my tab.
