I'm a marine scientist from Brazil, mainly interested in coral conservation and how connectivity modeling can be used for securing ocean biodiversity in the face of climate change. Graduated in Oceanography at the <a href='https://www.io.usp.br/'>University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP)</a> and Master in Remote Sensing from the <a href='https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br'>National Institute for Space Research (INPE)</a>, I had so far also worked with statistical analysis applied to paleoclimate events, influence of land-use change in water quality parameters, oceanic fronts and marine heatwaves variability. You can read more about these topics in the <a href='https://silvaglx.github.io/blog/'>research</a> and <a href='https://silvaglx.github.io/publications/'>publications</a> tabs. Currently, I'm a research student at the Tokyo Institute of Technology under the <a href='http://www.nakamulab.mei.titech.ac.jp/en/'>Nakamura Laboratory</a>.
