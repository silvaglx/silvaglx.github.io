  abstract={Despite increasing attention to Red Sea hydrodynamics over the past few years, the interaction between the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea, as well as the possible natural mitigation mechanisms of heat stress on the southern coral reef zones, have not been adequately examined. To understand the three-dimensional nature of thermal variability in the Red Sea, this study examines several Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations using a nesting approach in the southern parts of the GOS. On a TSUBAME 3.0 supercomputer operated by the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the regional ROMS model was used to simulate general circulation patterns and sea surface temperatures. Ultimately, satellite data spanning 2016-2020 were used to validate the regional model. An offline nesting approach was used to simulate the local 3-D thermal regimes of the northern islands region due to the scarcity of distributed depth-varying temperature data. Intriguingly, the nested model scenarios confirmed an unusual thermal moderating mechanism involving northern islands that act as barriers to influences from the eastern boundary current. A new approach is also presented to using higher-resolution models to precisely represent thermal indices in space and time that surpasses the widely used remote sensing methodologies. Shortly, multiscale modeling provides a valuable tool for assessing the thermal regimes around one of the Red Sea's most precious marine ecosystems.},
