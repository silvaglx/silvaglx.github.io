  abstract={The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) is a global warming event that occurred at around 40 Ma and lasted about 500 kyr. We study this event in an abyssal setting of the Tasman Sea, using the IODP Core U1511B-16R, collected during the expedition 371. We analyse magnetic, mineralogical, and chemical parameters to investigate the evolution of the sea bottom conditions at this site during the middle Eocene. We observe significant changes indicating the response to the MECO perturbation. Mn oxides, in which Mn occurs under an oxidation state around +4, indicate a high Eh water environment. A prominent Mn anomaly, occurring just above the MECO interval, indicates a shift toward higher pH conditions shortly after the end of this event. Our results suggest more acid bottom water over the Tasman abyssal plain during the MECO, and an abrupt end of these conditions. This work provides the first evidence of MECO at abyssal depths and shows that acidification affected the entire oceanic water column during this event.},

  abstract={The rising trend in sea surface temperature presents a threat to tropical coral reefs, causing increased mass bleaching and mortality events. Brazilian reefs have been characterized as less susceptible to thermal stress, where the assessment of bleaching events based on temperature anomalies often overpredicts its actual occurrences in comparison with other regions of the global ocean. With coral reefs acclimatized to local environmental conditions, larval connectivity presents a potential role in introducing organisms adapted to different temperature conditions. In the present study, we evaluated the connectivity patterns of Brazilian coral reefs, verifying its potential influence on the variation of thermal stress tolerance supported by these communities. Connectivity was estimated based on 27-year larval dispersion simulations, from 1993 to 2019, among 180 reef sites distributed in seven ecoregions on the Brazilian continental margin. Simulations were performed using a biophysical model coupling ocean currents data and life history traits of Mussismilia hispida, a widespread stony-coral type species and one of the major endemic reef builders in the South Atlantic. The potential influence of larval connectivity on thermal stress tolerance was evaluated considering the probability of connections between each reef site, their respective bleaching thresholds, and the accumulation of sea surface temperature anomalies over 12-week periods. The results indicated that connectivity-influenced bleaching estimations were significantly closer to observations reported in the literature when compared to estimations without connectivity (p-value < 0.05). These findings present an evidence that larval connectivity may display a relevant role in the adaptation of Brazilian corals to changes in seawater temperature, leading to a potential variation of ± 0.3°C in local thermal stress thresholds. Different connectivity patterns assessed during the occurrence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation events were also observed in association with the migrations of the South Equatorial Current bifurcation. These conditions led to the disruption of connections between the Eastern and Northeastern reef sites during El Niño, and between the Northeastern and Amazon reef sites during La Niña. Ultimately, it is expected that those findings may contribute to the management of Brazilian coral reefs regarding changes in dispersal pathways and thermal stress tolerance given future climate change scenarios.},

  abstract={Ferromanganese (FeMn) crusts are Fe and Mn oxides that typically form on deep-sea elevations by deposition of colloids from seawater. These mineral deposits are considered a source of critical metals and rare earth elements. Besides their potential economic value, FeMn crusts are extremely relevant in ocean science, since their very slow growth rates result in long-term paleoenvironmental and paleoceanographic records. In this study, we applied geochemical, mineralogical, and magnetic analyses to unravel paleoenvironmental changes at two locations on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the Rio Grande Rise in the SW Atlantic and the Tropic Seamount in the NE Atlantic. Our results show that the occurrence of amorphous (non-crystalline) Fe oxyhydroxides and the absence of Fe oxides in hydrogenetic, non-phosphatized FeMn crusts prevented the development of primary remanent magnetization. In contrast, phosphatized FeMn crusts may have contained a remanent magnetic signal. Phosphatization resulted from increased primary productivity and occurred at different stages during the growth of the FeMn crusts, leading to suboxic conditions and partial dissolution of pre-existing, remanence-carrying magnetic minerals. Carbonate Fluorapatite (CFA) accumulation in the phosphatized layers of FeMn crusts replaced Fe and Mn, decreasing their magnetic content. Thus, magnetic variations do not reflect a primary magnetization but rather result from geochemical alterations. The loss of primary magnetization may hamper the use of FeMn deposits for magnetostratigraphic purposes.},

  abstract={Three decades have passed since the first documented coral bleaching event in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Rising sea surface temperatures continue to threaten coral conservation. Due to particular characteristics of Southwestern Atlantic coral communities, the influence of heat stress on bleaching events remains a challenge. Here, we review reports of coral bleaching over the past 30 yrs and their relationship to sea surface temperature anomalies. Coral bleaching reports were compiled from 1992 to 2022 and compared with bleaching predictions based on degree heating week (DHW) indices. Our results indicate that about 15% of the analyzed bleaching events were reported during periods of high DHW conditions. In contrast, 80% of these events occurred after 2010, coinciding with an average increase of 3 °C week in DHW values. These results support the expected increase in the influence of heat stress as one of the main causes of coral bleaching in recent years. In addition to a potential bias in bleaching reporting, corals near the coast between 3°S–9°S and 15°S–18°S appear to be historically most affected by heat stress events. Although no clear improvement in bleaching prediction performance was found by incorporating local SST variability into the DHW calculation, we suggest that extensive monitoring efforts could lead to a better understanding of this relationship under future climate change scenarios.},
